# Chicago-Divvy-DPA-Project

## Problem Statement 2

Identifying the need and feasibility (revenue) for new stations between 2 stations for providing parking spaces at heavy traffic stations. This is to ensure that divvy does not lose customers, based on the parking docks unavailability.

Description: Heavy stations are identified as stations from where most trips start and most trips end and not whose dock capacity is initially larger because we need to identify stations which are the busiest.
